Low-level features: 
  DSIFT (128D, vlfeat)
  dense sampling at multiple scales
  smapling step=8 pixels
  patch size=32 pixels
  resolution pyramid with 5 levels, obtained by subsampling using bilinear interpolation (factor of 0.707)
  dimensionality reduced to 80 by PCA (trained on 1M samples from the "trainval" set of PASCAL VOC 2007)

GMM with default parameters (trained on 1M samples from the "trainval" set)
  the differnce with the old implementation is that I added a Dirichlet prior on the weights (parameter "alpha"). This has a similar effect as the "nasty" trick of updating the mixture weights by using only the samples with a non-zero posterior

FV
  gradients w.r.t the mean and variances
  pnorm=2.0
  alpha=0.5

Linear SVMs trained using SGD (Le√≥n Bottou's code)
  hinge loss
  20 SGD iterations
  lambda = 1e-3
